# ML-Sentiment-Analysis-Chat-
Chat:
1. Structure the given data in such a way that sentiment analysis can be done at agent & customer level for each Interaction ID and overall score/polarity of the agent.
2. Find sentiment score/polarity for agent & customers for each Interaction ID

Predcitive Analysis:

1. Create a ML mode which takes above dataset as an input and predict the revenue for the given input period. For example, input dataset has monthly sales data from JAN-1999 to DEC-2017. 
Your ML model should take start and end month to be consider training the model and No of month as a input to predict the revenue. 
2. Your ML model should use 2 to 3 appropriate algorithm (for example, ARIMA, AARIMA, ETS, Holt-winters…etc) and compare the accuracy and return the most accurate result with accuracy in percentage.

Data Analysis and Classification:

1. Please focus more on the analysis part (cleaning, processing, feature engineering etc.), getting insights and visualizations. 
2. How you would apply machine learning models to predict the target variable (f1-score for the classification model = 0.5 is acceptable for the analysis).
